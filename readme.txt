Integrate a fancy slideshow in just five steps. - Rainbows. Rainbows everywhere.

== Description ==

Slideshow provides an easy way to integrate a slideshow for any Wordpress installation.

Any sized image can be loaded into the slideshow using the admin's media screen you're already
used to and once attached, will straight away be shown in your slideshow.

Fancy doing something crazy? You can create and use as many slideshows as you'd like, with
different images and settings for each one of them.

 - Show that visitor who's boss.


== Installation ==

1. Install Slideshow either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.

2. After activating Slideshow, you can create a new slideshow.

3. Attach images from the media page to your newly created slideshow.

4. Use the code snippet visible in your slideshow admin panel to deploy your slideshow anywhere on your website.

5. Feel like a sir.
